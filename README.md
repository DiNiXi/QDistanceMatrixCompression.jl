## Graphical Resistance Distance

The *resistance distance* between two nodes $ùëñ$ and $ùëó$ in a graph, is the resistance between two points on a corresponding electrical network, where each edge is replaced by a resistance of one ohm.

The resistance distance accounts for all possible paths between the two
nodes and reflects the effects of branching, diffusion, and network dynamics. It has proven a robust alternative to the geodesic distance (i.e., shortest path length), which can be
more sensitive to variations in topological structure, edge weight distribution, or both‚Äîespecially in real-world sparse networks. 

This package provides `Q-ray`, a high-performance Julia implementation that precomputes a compressed representation of the resistance distance matrix so that it can be queried (one-to-all and all-to-all) efficiently.
